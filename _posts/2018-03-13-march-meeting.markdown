## Hi everyone,
<br/>
Our upcoming meeting will be held on Wednesday **21st of March**, at **5.30pm, in room G.06, 50 George Square** (see map below). As usual, the meeting will be followed by drinks and chat in the Potting Shed. Our meetings are open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are very welcome!

Our first speaker is [Dr Milan Valášek](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/milan-valasek), postdoctoral tutor in Statistics, within the Department of Psychology at the University of Edinburgh. In this talk, he will be telling us about:

**Testing GUI apps** (code [here](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks/raw/master/2018-03-21/Milan_Valasek_tcltk_edinbR_talk.zip))<br/>

>At two previous meetings, we discussed building interactive GUI applications (David C Sterratt, 20 January 2016, see [here](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks/tree/master/2016-01-13)) and programmatic code testing (Dave Evans, 17 February 2016, see [here](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks/blob/master/2016-02-17/BehaviourDrivenDevelopment.pdf)).
 The present talk is motivated by a question that arose at the former of the two meetings, bringing these topics together: How do you build programmatic unit tests for R GUI apps? I will present one way of answering this question, using the `tcltk` package for building GUI apps in Tcl/Tk and the `testthat` package for programmatic code testing.


Our second speaker is [Dr Elliot Meador](https://www.sruc.ac.uk/emeador), researcher of rural economy and society, at Scotland's Rural College (SRUC). He will be talking about:

**Quantifying networks using survey data: Things your parents don't want you to know...**<br/>

> Social networks lie at the heart of many prominent social theories, and survey-driven research is a lasting methodology used in the social sciences.  In this talk, I review some approaches to conducting network analysis using survey data.  Specifically, I use R's `igraph` package and the tidyverse to create useful and easily understandable networks from survey data collected in rural areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. The following topics will be discussed: <br/>
**1.** Moving between graph types (i.e. creating bipartite graphs); <br/>
**2.** Using iterative approaches to matching node ID's (a common problem in found in the research design); <br/>
**3.** Tidying graph metrics; and <br/>
**4.** Creating informative network plots, as well as elegant ggplots.

For any newcomers, here's a map of where we'll be.
