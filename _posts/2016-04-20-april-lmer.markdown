# Multi-level models in R

Our next meeting will take place on Wednesday 20th April, **5.30pm** in Room LG.11 in David Hume Tower in the south-east corner of George Square 

**Note different venue!!**: [map here](https://goo.gl/maps/bHaWbxoYLs22)

Ian White will talk about [Mixed-effects models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model) in <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)">R</a>.

*Abstract*: Following a short review of available packages, I will give some illustrative examples of data for which the mixed model might be appropriate, and discuss the analysis of these data with either *lme* (in
package [nlme](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nlme) or *lmer* (in package [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4).

We'll head to [the potting shed](https://goo.gl/maps/YbNEWEVm3f42) after.

Meetings are open for all to attend (e.g. no University of Edinburgh card required). Hope to see you there! Please share widely.
