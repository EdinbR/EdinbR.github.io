## Hello everyone!
<br/>
This month I am delighted to announce that we will have a special guest from overseas: [**David Robinson**](http://varianceexplained.org/about/). Our upcoming meeting will be held on **Friday the 16th of February**, at **5.00pm** (in the George Square area, details TBD). Please note, this a one-off change from our usual third-Wednesday-of-the-month pattern.

The meeting will be followed by drinks and chat for roughly 1h, when you will have a chance to meet and chat to David. All welcome, but please grab an [Eventbrite ticket](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/tidy-text-mining-with-r-a-talk-by-david-robinson-tickets-42771316158) if you want to join.

**David Robinson** is a Data Scientist at Stack Overflow, where he analyzes data on the world's software developers to help them find answers to their programming questions and advance their careers. He is the co-author with [Julia Silge](http://juliasilge.com/) of the `tidytext` package and the O'Reilly book [Text Mining with R](https://www.amazon.com/Text-Mining-R-Tidy-Approach/dp/1491981652). He is also the author of the `broom`, `gganimate`, and `fuzzyjoin` packages and of the e-book [Introduction to Empirical Bayes](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Empirical-Bayes-Examples-Statistics-ebook/dp/B06WP26J8Q). He writes about R, statistics and education on his blog [Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/), as well as on Twitter as [@drob](https://twitter.com/drob). In this talk, he will be discussing:

**Tidy Text Mining with R**<br/>

>Text data is increasingly important in many domains, but it can be challenging to manipulate and visualize within typical R analysis workflows. In this talk, I will introduce the tidytext package and show how tidy data principles and tools can make text mining easier and more effective, by structuring text as one-token-per-row. You'll learn how to manipulate, summarize, and visualize text's characteristics using R packages from the tidy ecosystem such as dplyr, ggplot2, and tidyr. You'll see case studies of sentiment analysis, tf-idf, and topic modeling applied to examples from literature and Twitter, and gain the tools to draw conclusions from your own text datasets.


More details will follow, but meanwhile spread the word and sign up on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/tidy-text-mining-with-r-a-talk-by-david-robinson-tickets-42771316158)!
