## Hello everyone!
<br/>
This month I am delighted to announce that we will have a special guest from overseas: [**David Robinson**](http://varianceexplained.org/about/). Our upcoming meeting will be held on **Friday the 16th of February**, from **5.00pm**, in the ICMS Lecture Theatre (above The Data Lab - details & map below). Please note, this a one-off change from our usual third-Wednesday-of-the-month pattern.

The meeting will be followed by a small reception sponsored by [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/?utm_source=sponsor&utm_medium=image&utm_campaign=edinbR), where you will have a chance to meet and chat to David. All welcome, but please grab an [Eventbrite ticket](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/tidy-text-mining-with-r-a-talk-by-david-robinson-tickets-42771316158) if you want to join.

**David Robinson** is the Chief Data Scientist at DataCamp, where he works on analysis and research to help teach the next generation of data scientists. He is the co-author with [Julia Silge](http://juliasilge.com/) of the `tidytext` package and the O'Reilly book [Text Mining with R](https://www.amazon.com/Text-Mining-R-Tidy-Approach/dp/1491981652). He is also the author of the `broom`, `gganimate`, and `fuzzyjoin` packages and of the e-book [Introduction to Empirical Bayes](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Empirical-Bayes-Examples-Statistics-ebook/dp/B06WP26J8Q). He writes about R, statistics and education on his blog [Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/), as well as on Twitter as [@drob](https://twitter.com/drob). In this talk, he will be discussing:

**Tidy Text Mining with R**<br/>

>Text data is increasingly important in many domains, but it can be challenging to manipulate and visualize within typical R analysis workflows. In this talk, I will introduce the tidytext package and show how tidy data principles and tools can make text mining easier and more effective, by structuring text as one-token-per-row. You'll learn how to manipulate, summarize, and visualize text's characteristics using R packages from the tidy ecosystem such as dplyr, ggplot2, and tidyr. You'll see case studies of sentiment analysis, tf-idf, and topic modeling applied to examples from literature and Twitter, and gain the tools to draw conclusions from your own text datasets.


Some of the `R` code demoed at this meeting has kindly been reproduced by Jumping Rivers on their blog [here](https://blog.jumpingrivers.com/posts/2018/tidytext_edinbr_2018/).
