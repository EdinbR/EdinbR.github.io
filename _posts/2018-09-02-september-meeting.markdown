Hi everyone,
<br/>


Our upcoming meeting will be held one week earlier than usual, on Wednesday **12th of September**, from **5.00pm**. The venue is **50 George Square, room G.06** (see map below). As usual, the meeting will be open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are very welcome - and that includes the pub trip afterwards.


Our first speaker is [Alastair Kerr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alastair-kerr-37726732/), Bioinformatics Core Facility Manager (Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, University of Edinburgh). He will be presenting to us a short:

## Demo on R [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) <br/>

> R Markdown and R Shiny facilitate R-programmers to communicate their data and ideas to other people. But how can R code and data be made interoperable with other computers and programming languages? Representational State Transfer (REST), is a common standard that enables RESTful applications to communicate over HTTP and is found in many web services. The R package `plumber` adds this functionality easily to existing R code. I will explain what you need to know about creating your own RESTful program in R and `plumber`, highlighting some key features and security considerations. Assuming internet connections and firewalls are working as expected, there should also be a [live demo](https://github.com/AlastairKerr/plumberSeminar) that will allow you to interact with the apps using a laptop or smartphone.


<br/>

Our second speaker is [**Nevil Hopley**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nevilhopley/?ppe=1), Head of Mathematics at George Watson's College, and the author of [Calculator Software](http://www.calculatorsoftware.co.uk/cs/about.htm). He will be discussing:


## The Journey from R Scripts to R Markdown to Shiny

>After starting programming with R back in January 2017, Nevil Hopley has now arrived in the world of Shiny interactivity! This first talk (1 of 2) will describe a project that started as a simple R script, evolved into Rmarkdown and has now arrived in Shiny. There will be stories of many dead-ends, a few moments of enlightenment, and the professional help received from [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/?utm_source=sponsor&utm_medium=image&utm_campaign=edinbR) consultants. Youâ€™ll see `ggplot`, `plotly` and `networkD3` visualisations of school exam data as well as snippets of R code. Git and GitHub may even get a mention. Part 2 of the talk will conclude at a future EdinbR meeting.
