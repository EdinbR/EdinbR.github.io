Hi everyone,
<br/>


We are getting together for another evening of R on 20 November (last one this year!). So join us from 6.00pm in [Old College, Usha Kasera Lecture Theatre](https://www.ed.ac.uk/timetabling-examinations/timetabling/room-bookings/bookable-rooms3/room/0001_01_1.264). As usual, the meeting will be open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are very welcome. After the talks we'll be heading off to a nearby, so do come along!


Our speaker is [Riinu Ots](https://www.riinu.me), a data scientist with an interdisciplinary background, who 
works as [Senior Data Manager](https://www.ed.ac.uk/surgery/staff/profiles/riinu-ots) at the Centre for Medical Informatics, within The University of Edinburgh. She will be discussing:

## R Markdown – from RStudio to Word/PDF/website with a single push of a button

> I will demonstrate 2 things:
> - What is Markdown and how to get directly from R into Word documents, PDF reports, websites, or presentations
> - How to work with R Notebooks (twin sister of R Markdown) – an interactive alternative to R scripts
> This talk is suitable for R newbies: working examples will be provided. Experienced users will also benefit as I'll point out the most up to date functionality within R Markdown and RStudio.

In the second part of the meeting, we'll try something new. Since this is the final EdinbR meeting in 2019, we thought we'd close things off with a fun *R quiz*. There will be a prize for the winner at the end (the second edition of Hadley Wickham's _Advanced R_ book), so be sure to come along!

If you'd like to lend a hand with creating some interesting R quiz questions, you can share your details and ideas [here](https://forms.gle/NHJ3gv2LR4rnDW7g8), or let us know at info@edinbr.org.
