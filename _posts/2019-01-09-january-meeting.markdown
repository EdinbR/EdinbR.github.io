Hi everyone,
<br/>

Happy New Year and welcome back! Our first meeting in 2019 will take place on the 16th of January, from 5.30pm, in David Hume Tower, room LG.09 (see the map below for further details). The meeting will focus on tackling Twitter data. As usual, the meeting will be open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are very welcome!

Our **first speaker** is [Dr Elliot Meador](https://www.sruc.ac.uk/emeador), researcher of rural economy and society, at Scotland's Rural College (SRUC). He will be sharing details on:

## Visualising Twitter data using `igraph`, `ggraph` and `tidytext`

This talk looks at different approaches to visualising social networks using R. Using data pulled from Twitter, we will explore methods of visualising key trends in the data using a network approach. Specifically, this talk will cover: 
1) pulling Twitter data from the API using iterative programing; 
2) tidying the data using `dplyr` and `tidytext`; 
3) creating network graphs in `igraph`;
4) visualising the graphs using `ggraph`; and
5) doing sentiment analysis on interesting network parameters (i.e., community detection, etc).


Our **second speaker** is [Alasdair Sykes](https://www.sruc.ac.uk/asykes), agricultural modeller at SRUC. Alasdair has developed a [web app](https://www.fringebiscuit.com/trends-landing-page) for scraping tweets about the Fringe festival. The display uses Tableau, but the backend is R. A title and abstract will soon follow. 


<!-- I think some members of the group will be interested in the Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship Programme 2019. The Programme funds researchers and individuals passionate about research software use and/or development. Our Fellows also develop skills and knowledge around software sustainability network with like-minded individuals from a wide variety of research areas. Applications are now open to the Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship Programme 2019. Deadline for applications is 3rd February 2019. Could you promote it among the meetup? https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme -->
