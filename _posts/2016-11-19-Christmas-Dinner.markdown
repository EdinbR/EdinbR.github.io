We are now approaching the end of 2016, and no further EdinbR meetings will be taking place until January 18, 2017 - when we hope to see many of you around again!

Over the course of this year, we have had no fewer than 17 excellent talks, on topics such as: how to improve code speed and performance, tidying data, various types of statistical models (e.g., lasso regression and mixed-effects models, etc.), and handling map data in R. We are also proud to include [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) among our invited guests this year, who spoke to us about how to manage many models in R (details [here](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2016/05/11/may-Hadley-Update2-PostingTalk.html)).

To celebrate this and the approaching winter holidays, please join us for a friendly dinner over the next few weeks. If you would like to come along, just let us know in this [Doodle poll](http://doodle.com/poll/sh8r47xzhzmchmfz). You can also write to us at: [info@edinbr.org](mailto:info@edinbr.org) if you have any strong preferences regarding venues, etc.



We look forward to seeing you there!

EdinbR Team
