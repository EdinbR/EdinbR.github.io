In this first meeting we'll be refining the scheduling, logistics and topics for future meetings, as well as using it to gauge interest in the usergroup. All are welcome regardless of R experience, and afterwards there will likely be a visit to a nearby pub for those interested. If you can't make this meeting but plan to attend in future please do join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/edinbr) and follow us [on twitter](https://twitter.com/edinb_r).

For questions or more information you can post to the mailing list: [edinbr@googlegroups.com](mailto:edinbr@googlegroups.com) or reach the organisers at: [info@edinbr.org](mailto:info@edinbr.org).

Hope to see you there!
