As you may have seen on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/edinbr), there's no EdinbR meeting this month (July 2015). There's two (probably related) reasons for this: a lot of people are away at conferences or on holiday and we have no volunteer speakers!

EdinbR will be back August 19<sup>th</sup> (third Wednesday of the month) at 7 George Square, we'll announce the details nearer the time.

Anyone is welcome to speak at EdinbR, you needn't be an "expert" in the language (as we saw from [our survey](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2015/03/25/edinbr-survey-results.html), the majority of members self-describe as being beginner or intermediate level R users), so if you have a topic in mind you're interested in why not sign up to give a talk?

If you're stuck for ideas, here is a popularity ranking of some potential R talk topics, again from [our survey](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2015/03/25/edinbr-survey-results.html) a few months back:

You can contact us as [info@edinbr.org](mailto:info@edinbr.org) to volunteer, or catch us in person at the August meeting!
