We're very excited to announce the next EdinbR meeting: a webinar workshop on [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) delivered by Chris Campbell, Senior R Consultant at [Mango Solutions](http://www.mango-solutions.com/)!

The workshop will be at:

> Wednesday **June 17th**, 5-6pm in **Mb2, Appleton Tower**

Attendees will need to **bring a laptop** to work on! We also recommend you have a few things installed beforehand:

* The latest version of R ([3.2.0](http://www.r-project.org/))
* The R IDE [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
* The [shiny](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/index.html) R package
* You may also want to make an account on [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/)

If attendees could arrive 15 or so minutes before the start time we can get any troubleshooting out of the way and be ready for a prompt start at 5!

## Sign-up

The workshop is free to attend but space is reasonably limited so we're asking that you sign-up if you want to come along, as always anyone is welcome:

## Background

If you didn't manage to make our [last meeting](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2015/05/13/may-meeting.html), we had a great talk from Alastair Kerr giving an introduction to Shiny, you can see the slides [here](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks/blob/master/2015-05-20/Kerr_IntroductionToRShiny.pdf). There's also a load of great articles and tutorials on the [Shiny website](http://shiny.rstudio.com/).
