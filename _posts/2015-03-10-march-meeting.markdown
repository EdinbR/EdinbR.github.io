I'm pleased to announce the March meeting of EdinbR! Here are the details:

>Wednesday **18<sup>th</sup> March** 2015, **5-6pm** in room LT1, **7 Bristo Square**

This meeting we have two great short talks, interspersed with some words from the organisers on the results of our [survey](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2015/02/22/edinbr-survey.html) and other announcements. The schedule is:

* [Talk: **Intro to ggplot2** by Christophe Ladroue (15-20 mins)](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks/blob/master/2015-03-18/Sterratt_HowNotToSubmitAProjectToCRAN.pdf)
* EdinbR survey results and announcements (5-10 mins)
* [Talk: **How (not) to get your package accepted by CRAN** by David Sterratt (15-20 mins)](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks/blob/master/2015-03-18/Sterratt_HowNotToSubmitAProjectToCRAN.pdf)

Full descriptions of the talks will be posted to the the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/edinbr) â€” please do sign up there if you're not already receiving our emails!

Due to room availability there's a small change from our [first meeting](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2015/01/30/our-first-meeting.html): we're moving round the corner to [7 Bristo Square](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/estates-buildings/buildings-information/a-z-buildings-list?id=109&cw_xml=Building_profile.cfm). Google maps thinks it's a three-minute walk from 7 George Square where we were based last time:
