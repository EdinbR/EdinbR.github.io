Hi everyone,
<br/>
  
  
As it turns out, we _will_ have a meeting in August after all! So I hope you're back from holiday, because [Curtis Kephart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/curtiskephart/) from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is visiting Scotland around that time, and has offered to come give a talk. Until recently, Curtis was an academic economist, but at the moment he is working as [Community Organizer at RStudio](http://community.rstudio.com/) - which he will be able to share more about himself!

Specifically, the upcoming meeting will be held on Wednesday **15th of August**, at **4.00pm** (notice the slightly earlier start due to university timetabling issues). The venue is the Dugald Stewart Building, **room 1.20**. As usual, the meeting is open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are very welcome! If you want to join us, can you please let me know [**in this Google Form**](https://goo.gl/forms/BEVgLSXNG6rrwfEh2), as I'd like to get an idea of numbers.
<br/>
[FYI, all data is anonymous unless you provide contact details yourself as comments, and you will not need to log in to a Google account either].

So, Curtis will be discussing some cool features added recently for:

**RMarkdown in production**

>RMarkdown is a simple tool to mix your code (R, Python, Bash, etc.), results, and prose in a single document. In this talk we review a few extensions of this tool to make your data science workflow more efficient and your output more useful. <br/>
 * _Deploy to html, pdf, word, ppt, blogdown, bookdown and much more._ 
 * _RMarkdown Notebooks - Interact with and develop your document as you develop it._
 * _HTMLWidgets - Embedding interactive JavaScrip visualizations in your R Markdown doc is easy._
 * _Parameterized markdown documents - specify parameters to customize and further automate your analysis._
 * _FlexDashboards - Embedding interactivity (Shiny Apps) in R Markdown documents._



Should time allow it, Curtis can also give a quick demo of:

**RStudio Connect**

> [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) is a commercial product by RStudio. It allows for the deployment of data science artifacts super easy:
* _Push-button deployment of all sorts of RMarkdown docs, shiny apps, and plumber APIs._
* _Secure who has access to those reports._
* _Automate updating and distribution of those reports._ 





<br/>
<br/>
I do hope you'll join us, in which case here's a map of where we'll be:
