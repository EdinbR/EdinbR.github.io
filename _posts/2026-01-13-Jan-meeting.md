We will dig under the surface of SQA’s first publicly available Shiny app. In keeping with the app’s intended user experience, this talk will be in the format of a ‘choose your own adventure’. This means that the audience will decide which features of the app that they want to hear about, including the hurdles that were overcome during its development. Start exploring the app now at: [http://qualifications.shinyapps.io/nq_progression/](qualifications.shinyapps.io/nq_progression/)

[Ozan Evkaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ozanevkaya/), Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh
 
R programming language is giving a real ecosystem for the high dimensional data modeling tools. As one specific case, copula theory has a great open source R packages community for implementation of various models. From bivariate to multivariate scenarios, there are rich and commonly used R packages maintained for a long time. This brief talk targets to spark audience attention by giving a general overview of copula modeling and available tools in R environment, may include short demonstrations on multivariate data sets.
