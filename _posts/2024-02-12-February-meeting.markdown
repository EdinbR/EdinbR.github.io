## Supercharge your R practice with pair programming

Pair programming is a technique widely used in software development. Having two developers work together on a single coding task results in code that is cleaner, less buggy and more efficient. Pair programming also improves the developers’ communication skills and makes coding more accessible to people from minority groups. In this session, we’ll introduce the technique and invite you to try it out – you’ll be put into pairs and given R programming challenges to solve together.
