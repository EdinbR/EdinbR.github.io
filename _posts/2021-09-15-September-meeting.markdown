Hi everyone,
<br/>


The first session of 2021/22 will be on September 15th, join us from 5.30pm online! As usual, the meeting is open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are especially welcome.

In order to join us, please register with [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/EdinbR/).
We've set up a chat group for EdinbR, come and catch up with the community on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#edinbr:matrix.org).
Our talk this month will primarily be available on Matrix - along with session chat.
We will also be running a stream to YouTube, if you are unable to join us on Matrix.


Our speakers are Andrew Collier and Joe Adams.

## `emayili` - A tidy package for sending emails from R

### [Andrew Collier](https://twitter.com/datawookie)

[`emayili`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emayili/) is a library for easily sending emails from R. It has minimal dependencies and intuitive syntax. I'll talk a little about email in general, what motivated me to build `emayili` and what I have learned along the way.

## How the Scottish Government used R to build a COVID-19 dashboard

### Joe Adams

The Scottish Government has used a range of evidence to inform decisions about COVID-19. Find out how this evidence was gathered into a single public facing [dashboard](https://data.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/) to build transparency and public engagement. You will hear about specific technical decisions, our design process, and the lessons we learnt.
