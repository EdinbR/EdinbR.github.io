The next EdinbR meeting will be:

> Wednesday **November 18th**, 5-6pm in S1, **7 George Square**. This is back to our usual venue

This month's meeting is themed around good coding practise. We have two speakers lined up:

* Caterina Constantinescu: Good coding practices in R

Coding standards for a given language are meant to improve clarity and collaboration, and can be essential for maintaining and enhancing older scripts. This talk will briefly highlight a set of guidelines for good coding practices in R. I will present a set of standards devised specifically for R, as well as some guidelines which can be extrapolated from Python and Java, referring for instance to file organisation, commenting, the appropriate use of white space, naming conventions etc. 

* Guillaume Devailly: "Interactive heatmaps in R with d3heatmap and plotly"



The second difference is that we're having a pub social afterwards in the Potting Shed (just around the corner for 7 George Square). If you can't make the talks you are more than welcome to join us in the pub from 6pm onwards. 

For any newcomers (you're very welcome!), here's a map of we'll be. The entrance faces the McEwan Hall:
