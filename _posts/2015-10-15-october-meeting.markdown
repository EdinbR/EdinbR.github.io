The next EdinbR meeting will be:

> Wednesday **October 21st**, 5-6pm in S1, **7 George Square**

This month's meeting will be a little different from usual. First, we're going to have lightning talks.

We have five speakers lined up, who'll each talk for five minutes and you can ask questions for up to five minutes. These nuggets of R wisdom will be provided by:

- Christophe Ladroue: "Write a closure and make your life easier" 
- Martin Graham: “Using R for topic modelling”
- Guillaume Devailly: "Interactive heatmaps in R with d3heatmap and plotly"
- Dave Evans: "Applied non-negative matrix factorisation"
- Rene Mottus: "Using stepwise multi-levels models vs multi-level models with LASSO penalization to analyse relatively high-dimensional nested data" 

The second difference is that we're having a pub social afterwards in the Potting Shed (just around the corner for 7 George Square). If you can't make the talks you are more than welcome to join us in the pub from 6pm onwards. 

For any newcomers (you're very welcome!), here's a map of we'll be:
