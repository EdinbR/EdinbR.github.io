**Effective data visualisation**
> Data visualisation is a very trendy topic nowadays. So is R. In this talk Iâ€™ll give you some tips and guidelines to think about next time you need to visualise your data and communicate the findings of your research.

<br>
Our second speaker is [Caterina Constantinescu](http://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/caterina-constantinescu), who is part of the EdinbR team, and also a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. The topic of discussion will be:

**Making sense of Twitter data**
> In this talk, I will show you how to access your Twitter account's data, using the [`TwitteR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/index.html) R package. I'll also demo some useful code, including data manipulations, example analyses and some graphics.

See you there!
