This month's meeting will be held on Wednesday **19th of April**, at **5.00pm**, in **Chrystal MacMillan Building, Seminar Room 2** (same as G.02). As usual, the meeting will be followed by drinks and chat in the Potting Shed. Everyone is welcome, particularly newcomers and/or beginners!

Our first speaker is [Victoria Avila](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoriaavilaregidor/), Assistant Statistician and data visualisation champion at the National Records of Scotland, who will talk about:

**Effective data visualisation** (see `.pptx` [here](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks/raw/master/2017-04-19/EdinbR.org%20-%20April%20-%20Victoria%20Avila%20-%20Data%20Visualisation.pptx), and `.pdf` [here](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks/raw/master/2017-04-19/EdinbR.org%20-%20April%20-%20Victoria%20Avila%20-%20Data%20Visualisation.pdf))
> Data visualisation is a very trendy topic nowadays. So is R. In this talk Iâ€™ll give you some tips and guidelines to think about next time you need to visualise your data and communicate the findings of your research.

Our second speaker is [Caterina Constantinescu](http://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/caterina-constantinescu), who is part of the EdinbR team, and also a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. The topic of discussion will be:

**Making sense of Twitter data** (see `R` code [here](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks/blob/master/2017-04-19/MakingSenseOfTwitterData_NoCodes.R), and get `.RData` [here](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks/raw/master/2017-04-19/TwitterAnalysisData.RData))
> In this talk, I will show you how to access your Twitter account's data, using the [`TwitteR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/index.html) R package. I'll also demo some useful code, including data manipulations, example analyses and some graphics.
