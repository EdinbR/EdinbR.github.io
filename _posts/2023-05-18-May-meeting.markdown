## Exploring the use of Glasgow's greenspaces using mobile phone app data

### [Dr Michael Sinclair](https://www.ubdc.ac.uk/about-ubdc/who-we-are/team-profiles/researchers/michael-sinclair/)

Mobile phone app data offers vast potential as an alternative to more traditional forms of data. However, there are uncertainties in how well these data represent the population which may limit their use. Through the case study of Glasgowâ€™s greenspaces, this research uses R to explore the representativeness of mobile phone app data and uses said data to explore greenspace use, including estimating visitation numbers and patterns of use for different groups.

## Scale your workflow beyond memory limits with Arrow

### [Dr Mike Spencer](http://mikerspencer.com/)

We've all struggled with available hardware limits, whether that's on a laptop or large server. There's always a job too big for the available memory (RAM). One way of solving this is using the Arrow package, which is much easier than you might imagine! In this talk Mike will walkthrough using Arrow with dplyr and how to make the most of this workflow.
