We are very pleased to announce that next month, we will be hosting a workshop on the `ggplot2` R package. Read on to find out more, and please note: limited places available!

If you've ever stuck to R base graphics because `ggplot2` seemed too complicated, this is your chance to get a **free**, practical introduction, on the **17th of May, 4-6pm, room 1.17**, in Dugald Stewart Building.

This workshop will guide you through the process of creating `ggplot2` graphics with various geometries and layers, using fills, gradients and themes, as well as creating sub-graphics or facets.

For this workshop, you will need to follow the exercises and examples along with the speaker: Dr. [Alastair Kerr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alastair-kerr-37726732/). Therefore please bring a fully-charged laptop if you can, as you will get more out of the session if you do.


Workshop pre-requisites:
* Fully-charged laptop.
* A copy of the [workshop material](https://github.com/AlastairKerr/Tutorials/blob/master/ggplot/ggplot.Rmd).
* Having R and the `ggplot2` package installed, as well as the additional packages specified in the GitHub link above. But do not worry if some do not install properly, as these are not central to the session.
* If you have RStudio installed, following the session using the Rmd file from GitHub will be much easier.
