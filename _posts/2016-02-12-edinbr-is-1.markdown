This February's meeting (5pm, 17th Feb, S1 in 7 George Square) will mark the first anniversary of EdinbR. We're very grateful to all of you for making the group a success, and are indebted to those of you who have contributed no fewer than 20 excellent talks. Thank you! 

A number of you have approached us with various suggestions and comments on how we could improve EdinbR. We've created a short 5 min survey and would appreciate if you took the time to answer [here](http://bit.ly/1PQLW8K).

Finally, as always, we are still looking for speakers for February to April, so if you have a 20/25/50 minute talk or tutorial you could contribute, please contact [Mhairi](mhairihmcneill@gmail.com) with your idea and we'll endeavour to make it happen. 

Best wishes and thanks again, 

EdinbR Team 
Tim, Susie, Victoria, Mhairi, Caterina (& Ben!).
