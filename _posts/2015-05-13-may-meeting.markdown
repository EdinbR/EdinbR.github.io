The next EdinbR meeting will be:

> Wednesday **May 20th**, 5-6pm in S1, **7 George Square**

We decided [last meeting](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2015/04/16/april-meeting.html) that 7 George Square would be our permanent venue for the time being, so we've booked a few meetings in advance for the **3rd Wednesday of each month**, if you want to mark these in your diaries those dates will be:

1. May 20th
2. June 17th
3. July 15th
4. August 19th
5. September 16th

Back to this meeting — we have two great talks lined up:

* **Introduction to R-Shiny** by [Alastair Kerr](https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/alastair-kerr/32/267/377) (Bioinformatics Core Facility Manager, Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, University of Edinburgh) <br />
  [Shiny](http://rstudio.github.io/shiny/tutorial/) is a package from RStudio that makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R. In this talk I will introduce the basics of the R-shiny package and server and demonstrate how a few lines of code can get a fully functional app for data exploration. I'll show examples where it has been very useful in our Bioinformatics Core Facility for creating interactive tables and figures for our users. ([Slides preview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QBBllY9exY6dyyhRXYQ_8f0M8gc25DDmDoLcaZlLhmI/edit?usp=sharing))
* **Building interactive plots (the easy way) in R** by [Ben Moore](http://blm.io) (Bioinformatics PhD student) <br />
  I’ll show some examples of how you can create interactive javascript plots in R without any js knowledge using the [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/) package as well as newer spin-out packages like leaflet and rcdimple. I’ll talk about the growing trend of gluing together R and web libraries using [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/), and even more broadly how online interlanguage function repositories can be accessed from R.

Here's a reminder of where we'll be, note you do not need a University of Edinburgh card to enter, the meeting is open to anyone interested in coming!
