The next meeting will be held on 

> Wednesday **March 16th**, 5-6pm in S1, 7 George Square.

Followed by a pub social (probably in the Potting Shed).

We have three speakers lined up:

* Caterina Constantinescu: EdinbR Survey Results + Discussion

* Tim Foster: Rate bicycle infrastructure in your area using R and OpenStreetMap

> Summary: How much bicycle infrastructure exists across the regions of Scotland, how does that compare to Amsterdam, Malmo and Copenhagen? And how much would it cost to improve the infrastructure in Scotland to a match these exemplars? See how these questions can be answered using open data, geo-databases, R packages and visualised in shiny app. In an almost reproducible work flow.

* Tim Bates: Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) in R using umx and OpenMx

> Abstract to follow

For any newcomers (you're very welcome!), here's a map of we'll be.
