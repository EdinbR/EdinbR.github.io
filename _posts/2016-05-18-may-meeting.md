The next meeting will be held on Wednesday **18th May**, 5.30-6.30pm in S1, 7 George Square, followed by a pub social in the Potting Shed. We'll have someone at the main door to make sure you can get in.

We have two speakers:

* [Juan Fumero](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1369892/): FastR-Flink

> During the past few years R has become an important language for data analysis, data representation and visualization. R is a very expressive language which combines functional and dynamic aspects, with laziness and object oriented programming. However the default R implementation is neither fast nor distributed, both features crucial for "big data" processing. In this talk I will present FastR-Flink, a compiler based on Oracle's R implementation, FastR, with support for some constructs of Apache Flink, a Java framework for distributed data processing. The Apache Flink operations such as map, reduce or filter are integrated at the compiler level to allow the execution of distributed stream and batch data processing applications directly from the R programming language with minimal effort. This work has been initiated at Oracle Labs during my recent internship with them in Linz, Austria.


* [Mike Spencer](https://scottishsnow.wordpress.com/): Snow through space and time with R

> Mike will speak about his PhD research, which has considered snow cover and melt across Scotland. His work has revolved around the historic Snow Survey of Great Britain dataset (DOI: 10.1080/14702541.2014.900184) and has included point and gridded modelling of snow cover and melt. He's used R as a general programming language, as well as for data analysis. Expect the talk to cover parallel processing, R for spatial analysis (including linking with GIS) and working with databases.

For any newcomers (you're very welcome!), here's a map of we'll be.

Meetings are open for all to attend (e.g. no University of Edinburgh card required). Hope to see you there!
