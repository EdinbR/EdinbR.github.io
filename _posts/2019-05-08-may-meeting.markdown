Hi everyone,
<br/>



Our next meeting will take place on the 15th of May, from 5.30pm, in Old College, [Lecture Theatre 1.264](https://www.ed.ac.uk/timetabling-examinations/timetabling/room-bookings/bookable-rooms3/room/0001_01_1.264) (see the map below for further details). As usual, the meeting will be open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are very welcome!


Our first speaker is [**Greg Sutcliffe**](https://emeraldreverie.org/). Greg is a Community Data Scientist at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en), focusing mainly on supporting the Ansible and Foreman communities. He's interested in how communities work, how to characterise them, and how to use data to help guide their governance particularly at scale (as well as pretty graphs..!). He will be arguing that:

## 'No, you can't just take the mean...'
### A Beginners Guide to Survival Analysis in R
(html [here](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks/blob/master/2019-05-15/GregSutcliffe_talk.html))

>Time-to-event data has some quirks that can make it tricky to characterise. In this talk, we briefly cover the basics of survival analysis, how to construct some basic models and plots in R, and finally
look at a real application of this technique in the world of open source communities.




Our second speaker will be [**Louise Sing**](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/staff/louise-sing/), spatial scientist at [Forest Research](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/) and PhD student in Geosciences at the University of Edinburgh. This month Louise will continue our series of talks on Shiny, this time with a focus on introductory-level Shiny:

## How R made my PhD Shiny: Communicating research outputs using Shiny
(pdf [here](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks/blob/master/2019-05-15/LouiseSing_Rshiny.pdf))

> As a relatively inexperienced R user I'll explain how I've used Shiny to communicate the outputs from my research on the modelled effects of forest management for a range of environmental and social benefits. I'll describe how I've constructed the Shiny tool to present the data in different forms, and how it's helping to inform forest planning in Scotland.
