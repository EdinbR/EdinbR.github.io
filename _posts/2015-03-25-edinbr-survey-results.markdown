Thank you to everyone who filled in the [EdinbR survey](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2015/02/22/edinbr-survey.html)! We had 75 responses (and a few more after I grabbed the results) â€” here's some quick analysis, all done in R of course. The code and data for these figures are available on our [github account](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-survey).

### Who's coming to EdinbR meetings?

It looks like the majority of our audience would describe themselves as having an "intermediate" level of R knowledge, but there's a good number of beginners too. The overall number of attendees is promising too: 43 said they'd attend either every meeting or most meetings!

### When's the best time and day for meetings?

Together the results for the best time and day were potentially biased by our very [first meeting](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2015/01/30/our-first-meeting.html) (which happened at Wednesday 5pm)...

Regardless this result means we'll stick with Wednesdays at 5pm for now.

### Where should meetings be held?

Again strong support for the status quo: George square (and Bristo square, informatics etc.) are nice, central locations which are ideal for those based in the city centre and a decent compromise for those further afield, such as  EdinbR attendees from the [IGMM](http://www.igmm.ed.ac.uk/) or [King's Buildings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Buildings).


### What do we want to hear about?

We had a rough and very non-comprehensive list of potential topics for future meetings and asked respondents to select those they were interested in hearing about.

This gives a good road map for upcoming EdinbR meetings: if you could give a talk about any of the above topics then do let us know! You can reach me by [email](mailto:ben@edinbr.org) or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/benjaminlmoore).
