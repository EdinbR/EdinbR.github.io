During our great [first meeting](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2015/01/30/our-first-meeting.html), we decided it would be good to poll more widely on the best time, days and venues for meetings. We'd like as many people who are interested to be able to attend, so it's important to get the details right from the outset!

To this end, we've put together a really short [online survey](http://goo.gl/forms/bQvmEj8zYZ), if you're interested in attending EdinbR we'd really appreciate your feedback:

The survey will stay available for a week or so and we'll post the results in a future blog post (fields about talk topics, sponsors etc. will be kept private). Thanks for helping!
