# Hadley Wickham: Managing many models with R 

**Register [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/edinbr-special-session-guest-hadley-wickham-tickets-24055271966)**

[Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz) will be speaking at EdinbR at **noon**, on **Saturday the 30th of April**. The venue will be in the **George Square Lecture Theatre** (map provided in the Eventbrite link below). This should be a great talk and a (catered) networking opportunity for all. We ask that you register at the EventBrite link [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/edinbr-special-session-guest-hadley-wickham-tickets-24055271966). 

Below is the summary of the talk, which is kindly supported by The Data Lab, MBN Solutions and the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences at the University of Edinburgh:


**Abstract**: *Visualisation alone is not enough to solve most data analysis challenges. The data may be too big or too messy to show in a single plot. In this talk, I'll outline my current thinking about how the synthesis of visualisation, modelling, and data manipulation allows you to effectively explore and understand large and complex datasets. There are three key ideas:* 

*1. Using tidyr to make nested data frame, where one column is a list of data frames.*

*2. Using purrr to use function programming tools instead of writing for loops.*

*3. Visualising models by converting them to tidy data with broom, by David Robinson.* 

*This work is embedded in R so I'll not only talk about the ideas, but show concrete code for working with large sets of models. You'll see how you can combine the [dplyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr) and [purrr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/purrr) packages to fit many models, then use [tidyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/tidyr) and [broom](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/broom) to convert to tidy data which can be visualised with [ggplot2](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ggplot2).*


This event is open for all to attend (e.g. no University of Edinburgh card required). Hope to see you there!
