## opendatascot - an R package to collect Scottish Official Statistics

### [Gordon Bryden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordon-bryden-72670952/)

statistics.gov.scot is the central source for Scottish official statistics. [opendatascot](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/opendatascot) is an R package designed to allow for easy downloading and exploration of this resource using simple and comfortable functions, and returning tidy formatted data ready for analysis, visualisation and app production. This talk will demonstrate the usage of this library, expose some of its under-the-hood workings, and show its journey from an ad-hoc collection of functions to a well maintained and documented library thanks to the R Packages book.

## Ace a Technical Interview, using R

### [Nevil Hopley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nevilhopley/)

This talk will describe the preparation of a pre-interview task for a Data Analyst job. After sourcing a data set in Excel from a website, it is then imported into RStudio, reshaped, cleaned, filtered and then some visualisation decisions applied to generate ggplot graphics for inclusion in an interview presentation. No careers were harmed during the making of this talk. There will also be opportunity for audience members to constructively critique both the code and the approach used!
