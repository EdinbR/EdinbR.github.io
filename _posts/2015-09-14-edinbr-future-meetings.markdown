### A common page we can edit to build a meeting plan

[This google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10cD1SujlEvIDbbvIhApyD8gX690upVKnicWWC1efyxg/edit?usp=sharing) will provide a flexible method for the organizers to collaborate planning future meetings, and for others to see what has been offered. If should be easier to share than a github markdown doc, as changes are real-time, collaborated, and visual.

If you'd like to be added for edit privileges, just send me your gmail.
