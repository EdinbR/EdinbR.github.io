Hi everyone,
<br/>


Our Febrary session will be on 19th, so join us from 6.00pm in [Old College, Usha Kasera Lecture Theatre](https://www.ed.ac.uk/timetabling-examinations/timetabling/room-bookings/bookable-rooms3/room/0001_01_1.264) ([map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/33710)). As usual, the meeting will be open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are very welcome. After the talks we'll be heading off to a pub nearby, so do come along!


Our speakers are Greg Sutcliffe and Juliette Maire. Greg is a community data scientist at Ansible and Red Hat. Juliette is a PhD student at Scotland's Rural College.

## Roots'n'All - Working with Tree Structures in R
<br/>

### [Greg Sutcliffe](https://twitter.com/Gwmngilfen)

Tree structures are common - from the files on your computer to the hierarchy of your organisation, there's a wealth of data contained both within the objects of the tree *and* the links between them. There are many questions one might wish to ask of such a tree, concerning the depth/breadth of the whole tree, or calculations across parts of it.

Working with the trees is made possible in R via the `data.tree` library, and visualization can be done with `ggraph` extensions to ggplot2. In this talk, we'll cover how to create a tree object (say, from a data frame), how to calculate some properties on each part of the tree, and how to visualize the result.

## Manipulating and visualizing weather data

### [Juliette Maire](https://www.sruc.ac.uk/jmaire)

Large-scale weather dataset (historical or predictions) is usually a "big" multidimensional dataset that includes space, time components and various variables such as rain, temperature, wind speed. Weather dataset is often saved as NetCDF file. This talk is a quick introduction to how to simply handle such files, extract or manipulate data from it,  and visualize the results in R.
