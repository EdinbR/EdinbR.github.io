Following in the footsteps of successful R meetups around the UK (e.g. [CambR](http://www.cambr.org.uk/), [LondonR](http://www.londonr.org/)), we present EdinbR: the Edinburgh R usergroup! There are a lot of researchers in and around Edinburgh that have great knowledge of R but as yet we lack a city-wide community. We hope to rectify this by building a network of R users through informal monthly meetings. Details of our inaugural meetup are to be confirmed but we will soon be reaching out to the many Edinburgh-based institutions to invite those who may be interested to attend!
