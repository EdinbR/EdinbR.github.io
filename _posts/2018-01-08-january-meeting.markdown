## Welcome back after the winter break!
<br/>
We are back for more R talks in 2018! Our upcoming meeting will be held on Wednesday **17th of January**, at **5.30pm, in G.06, 50 George Square** (on the ground floor - see map below). As usual, the meeting will be followed by drinks and chat in the Potting Shed. Meetings are open for all to attend and newcomers / beginners are very welcome. Y'know, the usual. :-)

Our first speaker is [Michael Spencer](http://mikerspencer.com/), data scientist and hydrologist. Mike has a PhD from the University of Edinburgh, and has researched snow melt frequency, as well as the link between snow cover and climate fluctuations, using computer simulation, machine learning and statistics. In this talk, he will be telling us about:

**Getting started with spatial data**

>This talk will be a brief introduction to using R (and other open source software) for working with spatial data. The talk will cover:
* _types of spatial data_
* _which software for different parts of your workflow_
* _some examples of spatial analysis including:_
  - _shortest path between locations_
  - _allocation networks_
  - _digital terrain models_  
>_Some of these topics are shown in the blog post [here](https://scottishsnow.wordpress.com/2017/11/13/spatial-networks-stjames-2/)._


<br>
Our second speaker is [Susan Johnston](https://sejohnston.com/), who is a Royal Society Research Fellow within the Institute of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Edinburgh. 

>Her topic and abstract will soon follow!

For any newcomers, here's a map of where we'll be.
