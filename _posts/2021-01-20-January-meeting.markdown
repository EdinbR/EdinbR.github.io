Hi everyone,
<br/>


The first session of 2021 will be on January 20th, so join us from 5.30pm online. As usual, the meeting will be open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are very welcome.

Our online meetings are kindly being enabled by [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/). In order to join us you need to register with [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/EdinbR/).


Our speakers are Alberto Arcagni and Jonathan Sidi.

* **Alberto Arcagni** is an assistant professor in statistics at the Sapienza University of Rome. His research topics concern income inequality, wellbeing, networks and partially ordered sets. He developed the R packages sBF, ineqJD and parsec.

* **Jonathan Sidi** Jonathan Sidi started using R close to 15 years ago, while a research student at the Bank of Israel. Currently, he is the Associate Director of Modeling and Simulation in a pharmaceutical company using R every day to model central nervous system diseases. He maintains and contributes to CRAN  packages such as `ggedit`, `ggeasy`, `remedy` and `carbonate` and way too many packages on GitHub.

## parsec: an R package for PARtially ordered sets in Socio-EConomics

### [Alberto Arcagni](https://web.uniroma1.it/memotef/users/arcagni-alberto)

In his talk he will describe the main tools provided by the R package "parsec" to define partially ordered sets (posets) and their application on the evaluation of multidimensional systems of ordinal indicators with a particular focus on socio-economic analysis.

## Unit Testing Shiny App Reactivity

### [Jonathan Sidi](https://twitter.com/yoniceedee)

When developing Shiny apps there is a lot of reactivity problems that can arise when one reactive or observe element triggers other elements. In some cases these can create cascading reactivity (the horror). The goal of `reactor` is to diagnose these reactivity problems and then plan unit tests to avert them during app development, making it a less painful and more robust experience.
