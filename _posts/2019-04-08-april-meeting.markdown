Hi everyone,
<br/>

Our next meeting will take place on the 17th of April, from 5.30pm, in Appleton Tower, room 2.14 (see the map below for further details). As usual, the meeting will be open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are very welcome!


Our **first speaker** is [Ksenia Aleksankina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ksenia-aleksankina-62816980/), Data Scientist at TravelNest. She will be discussing how to go:

## From laptop to cloud: making R work on Amazon AWS

>This talk looks at various ways R can be used within Amazon Web Services: from setting up and running an RStudio Server and a Shiny Server using Amazon Machine Image to deploying R code. Using some simple examples I will demonstrate how to set up an EC2 instance (a virtual server), analyse data stored in S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service), and host a Shiny app. 


Our second speaker will be [Liam Mason](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liammason/), GIS Analyst at Marine Scotland. His talk will focus on:

## Improving Accessibility in Data Visualisation #EndTheRainbow
(slides [here](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks/raw/master/2019-04-17/LiamMason_Accessibility_EndTheRainbow_EdinbR_20190402.pdf))

> Rainbow colour schemes are commonly used in data visualisation, particularly in climate science & meteorology. Liam will demonstrate how these colour scales can distort, mislead, and confuse your message, and offer some advice on how to improve your use of colour.
