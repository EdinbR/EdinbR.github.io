## Hamdullah Tunç: Using Response Surface Analysis to Examine the Role of Similarities in Dyadic Relations on Outcomes
 
[Hamdullah Tunç](https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/hamdullahtunc) is a PhD researcher in Clinical Psychology. His research focuses on the role of personal values, value similarities, and valued living in mental health. He employs quantitative methods to explore these relationships and has experience teaching research methods and statistics in social sciences. He is a student member of Royal Statistical Society.
 
There are various ways to investigate how similarities and differences between individuals relate to outcomes such as anxiety levels. While correlation and difference scores are commonly used to assess similarity, these techniques have significant limitations.
Response Surface Analysis (RSA) offers a more robust approach to testing congruency hypotheses by considering all possible combinations of predictors in relation to the outcome variable.
In this talk, we will introduce sample congruency hypotheses, demonstrate how to conduct Response Surface Analysis, visualise associations using 3D plots, and interpret the results. This session will provide both theoretical insights and practical applications, making it useful for researchers interested in dyadic relationships.
Please let me know if you need any further information.

## Nevil Hopley: Ten things to make you go oooooh! ... in R
 
Nevil is currently a Senior Data Analyst at the Scottish Qualifications Authority, and Treasurer of the Royal Statistical Society's Edinburgh Local Group.
 
Nevil will demonstrate ten different RStudio settings and coding choices that he now uses on a regular basis, which help make data analysis an even more fulfilling experience than it already is. He hopes that during this 20 minute talk, every audience member will go 'oooooh!' at least once. If they don't, then the title of this talk was wildly over-optimistic.
