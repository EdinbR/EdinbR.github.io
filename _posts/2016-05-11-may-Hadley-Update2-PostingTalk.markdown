As many of you know, [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz) visited Edinburgh on **Saturday, the 30th of April, 2016**. We are very pleased to announce that you can now view his talk below:

As a reminder, here is the summary of the talk for all those interested:

**Abstract**: *Visualisation alone is not enough to solve most data analysis challenges. The data may be too big or too messy to show in a single plot. In this talk, I'll outline my current thinking about how the synthesis of visualisation, modelling, and data manipulation allows you to effectively explore and understand large and complex datasets. There are three key ideas:* 

*1. Using tidyr to make nested data frame, where one column is a list of data frames.*

*2. Using purrr to use function programming tools instead of writing for loops.*

*3. Visualising models by converting them to tidy data with broom, by David Robinson.* 

*This work is embedded in R so I'll not only talk about the ideas, but show concrete code for working with large sets of models. You'll see how you can combine the [dplyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr) and [purrr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/purrr) packages to fit many models, then use [tidyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/tidyr) and [broom](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/broom) to convert to tidy data which can be visualised with [ggplot2](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ggplot2).*
