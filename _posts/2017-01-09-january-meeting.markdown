Hello everyone and welcome back from the winter holidays! We hope you are ready for another year of R talks.

These past few months, we've been improving our website: we are pleased to say we've now added a search bar, and you can now also leave us comments at the end of our posts, if you'd like to share your thoughts with us!

Our next meeting will be held on Wednesday **18th of January**, at **5.00pm, in LG.11, David Hume Tower** (on the lower ground floor). As usual, the meeting will be followed by drinks and chat in the Potting Shed.

<!--TO INSERT INSTEAD OF venue TBD: , in Room LG.11 in David Hume Tower. The entrance is via the 50 George Square building, and through its basement (feel free to ask for directions at the reception). -->

We will be welcoming [Dr Tom Booth](http://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/tom-booth) as our speaker this month. Tom is a lecturer in Quantitative Research Methods, and has been teaching statistics using R in the Department of Psychology, at the University of Edinburgh.

He'll give a one-hour talk on **Structural Equation Modelling using `lavaan`**:

> Structural equation modelling (SEM) is a powerful framework for data analysis, from simple linear models, to models which include measurement models for latent constructs and the relations between these constructs. The general SEM framework can be applied to data of almost any type, and include both continuous and categorical latent variables. In short, if you can think of it, you can probably do it in SEM. In this talk I will demonstrate the fundamentals of SEM in R using `lavaan`. We will consider a number of different model specifications, the types of questions they can answer, and how to interpret the output. The examples used will demonstrate a number of key features such as applying model constraints, multi-group analysis and nested model comparisons. We will consider the pro’s and con’s of `lavaan` versus other SEM packages within R.


Meetings are open for all to attend (e.g. no University of Edinburgh card required). For any newcomers (you're very welcome!), here's a map of where we'll be.
