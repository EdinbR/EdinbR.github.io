EdinbR is the Edinburgh usergroup for the [R programming language](http://r-project.org), started by researchers at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk). The aim of the group is to bring together scientists, statisticians and programmers from all over Edinburgh to discuss R related matters and learn from each other. The group also encourages collaboration between local R developers and organises training events for those interested in learning the language.

EdinbR meets monthly (on the third Wednesday of the month) and welcomes new attendees, regardless of R knowledge. You can stay up to date with our latest news via our [public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/edinbr/join), [@edinb_r](http://twitter.com/edinb_r), [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/EdinburghRusers) and [group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/EdinbR/).

All talks are archived collectively on our github [here](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks). You can also check out each of our posts for links to specific talks.

We are always looking for R enthusiasts, sponsors and partnerships, so please get in touch via [email](mailto:info@edinbr.org). We hope to hear from you and see you at our meetings!
