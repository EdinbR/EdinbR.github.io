EdinbR is the Edinburgh usergroup for the R programming language, started by researchers at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/home). The aim of the group is to bring together scientists, statisticians and programmers from all over Edinburgh to discuss R related matters and learn from each other. The group will also encourage collaboration between local R developers and organise training events for those interested in learning the language.

EdinbR meets monthly and welcomes new attendees, regardless of R knowledge. The group organisers can be reached via the [public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/edinbr) or through twitter at [@edinb_r](http://twitter.com/edinb_r).

We are looking for sponsors and partnerships, if interested please contact us as [info@edinbr.org](mailto:info@edinbr.org).
