EdinbR is the Edinburgh usergroup for the [R programming language](http://r-project.org). 

You can view our talks (from Sep 2020) on  [YouTube!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfB2mPM4oU5pMgh9gbEqpWA). Please subscribe to the channel to recieve updates.

We are always looking for R enthusiasts, sponsors and partnerships, so please get in touch - either in our [chat room on Matrix](https://app.element.io/#/room/edinbr:matrix.org), via [email](mailto:edinbr@proton.me), or speak to one of our conveners. We hope to hear from you and see you at our meetings!

EdinbR meets monthly (on the third Wednesday of the month) and welcomes new attendees, regardless of R knowledge. You can stay up to date with our latest news via our [public mailing list / Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/edinbr/join), [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@EdinbR) and [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/edinbr).

Many talks are archived collectively on [Github](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks). You can also check out each of our posts for links to specific talks.

EdinbR is convened by [Alessia](https://aelissa.github.io/), [Mike](https://mastodon.scot/@mikerspencer) and [Ozan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ozanevkaya).

Researchers at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk) started EdinbR in [February 2015](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2015/01/30/our-first-meeting.html) with the aim of bringing together scientists, statisticians and programmers from all over Edinburgh to discuss R-related matters. We encourage collaboration between local R users and organise training events for those interested in learning the language.
