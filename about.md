EdinbR is the Edinburgh usergroup for the [R programming language](http://r-project.org). 

You can view our talks (from Sep 2020) on  [YouTube!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfB2mPM4oU5pMgh9gbEqpWA). Please subscribe to the channel to recieve updates.

We are always looking for R enthusiasts, sponsors and partnerships, so please get in touch - either in our [chat room on Matrix](https://app.element.io/#/room/edinbr:matrix.org), or via [email](mailto:info@edinbr.org). We hope to hear from you and see you at our meetings!

EdinbR meets monthly (on the third Wednesday of the month) and welcomes new attendees, regardless of R knowledge. You can stay up to date with our latest news via our [public mailing list / Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/edinbr/join), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/edinb_r), [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/EdinburghRusers) and [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/EdinbR/).

All talks are archived collectively on our Github [here](https://github.com/EdinbR/edinbr-talks). You can also check out each of our posts for links to specific talks.

EdinbR is convened by [Federico](http://twitter.com/Chicco_Stat), [Mike](http://twitter.com/mikerspencer) and [Greg](https://twitter.com/Gwmngilfen). Read more about them in these [slides](./assets/conveners_january_2020.pdf).

Researchers at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk) started EdinbR in [February 2015](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2015/01/30/our-first-meeting.html) with the aim of bringing together scientists, statisticians and programmers from all over Edinburgh to discuss R-related matters. We encourage collaboration between local R users and organise training events for those interested in learning the language.
